                <h3>Why we collect, use and store this personal data</h3><br>
                <p>We are usually required to have a lawful basis to process your data. We explain each of these legal
                    bases below. We also set out the purposes for which we process your data. For each purpose, we
                    explain the lawful basis for that processing, the processing operations that we carry out and the
                    categories of data that we process.</p><br><br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Legal bases relied on by the FIA for processing described in this notice
                </h3><br><br>
                <p><span>Consent</span> – sometimes we ask for your consent to use your data. If we need this to process
                    any special category data, such as your health data, we will seek your explicit consent.</p><br>
                <p><span>Contract</span> – if we have an agreement in place with you, we may process your data where it
                    is necessary for us to meet our obligations or enforce our rights under the contract.</p><br>
                <p><span>Legitimate interest</span> – we can process your data when this is necessary for us to achieve
                    a business purpose, or where this is necessary for someone else to achieve their purpose. We explain
                    below what interests we, or others, are trying to achieve when we process your data. Where we
                    process personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest, then we consider what the impact of the
                    processing will be on affected individuals and to determine whether those individuals’ interests
                    outweigh our interests in the processing taking place.</p><br>
                <p><span>Legal obligation </span> – we have obligations to comply with legal and regulatory requirements
                    under various applicable laws. In certain cases, we have to use your data to meet these obligations.
                </p><br><br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Purposes</h3><br>
                <p>We process this personal data for the following purposes:</p><br><br>
                <h3>Fulfil a contract with you (contract)</h3><br>
                <p>Where you make a purchase from us or agree to take a service, including a ticket for an event, a
                    service or a place on a course, or enter a competition we run, we have to fulfil a contract, or take
                    steps linked to a contract. This means that we collect and use your personal data to: </p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>verify your identity;</li>
                    <li>take payments;</li>

                        services;</li>
                    <li>manage our contractual relationship with you.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>To do this we use your identification data, contact details, application-related information,
                    employment and business information and payment details. This information may be shared with certain
                    third parties to help us achieve this purpose. E.g. data and website hosts, ticketing providers,
                    payment providers and courier services.</p>

                necessary to ensure we provide adjustments or accommodations as part of a course you register to attend.
                We will typically process this on the basis of your explicit consent to the extent required by
                applicable data protection laws.</p><br>
            <p>This processing involves your identification data, contact details, profile analytics and usage data and
                technical data, application-related information; employment and business data and communication content.
            </p><br>
            <p>This information may be shared with certain third parties to help us achieve this purpose including IT
                and marketing and market research services providers, those providers who assist us in putting on our
                offline events and competitions and our professional advisors. Where you engage with a social network
                through our website, or reach our website from a social network, we may share personal data with that
                social network.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Direct marketing (legitimate interests or, where required, your consent)</h3><br><br>
            <p>We use your data to send you direct marketing about the FIA, our Competitions and Championships and our
                relevant products and services, or other products and services provided by us, our affiliates and
                carefully selected partners. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interest in promoting
                motorsport and the FIA, its partners and products and services, unless we are legally required to seek
                your consent. To do this we use your identification data, contact details, your profile, analytics and
                usage data, employment and business data and technical data.</p><br>
            <p>This information is shared with certain third parties to help us achieve this purpose such as IT service
                providers and marketing service providers. We also share information with our commercial partners where
                permitted by your consent or otherwise permitted by law.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Managing concerns around security (legitimate interests)</h3><br><br>
            <p>We have an interest in ensuring everyone that accesses our website or attends our premises or events are
                kept safe and that we maintain security across our offerings. This means we collect, analyse and use
                your data to:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>monitor customer accounts to prevent, investigate and/or report fraud, terrorism, misrepresentation,
                    security incidents or crime, in accordance with applicable law; </li>
                <li>we use CCTV and other security measures to protect the safety of those at our premises or events, to
                    provide evidence in relation to incidents taking place at our premises or events and to prevent and
                    detect unlawful activity;</li>
                <li>use data in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory and investigative purposes as
                    necessary (including disclosure of such information in connection with legal process or litigation).
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>To do this we use your identification details, your technical data, communications content, employment
                and business information and CCTV footage as appropriate.</p><br>
            <p>This information may be shared with certain third parties to help us achieve this purpose including our
                relevant third-party service providers such as event organisers and security providers, IT service
                providers, our professional advisers, relevant regulators, government authorities and/or law enforcement
                officials.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Verifying information (legitimate interests)</h3><br><br>
            <p>We have an interest in verifying information that you provide us with in order to use our website and
                attend our events and competitions. To do this we use your identification data, contact information and
                payment details.</p><br>
            <p>This information may be shared with certain of our third parties, e.g. if you provide a credit or debit
                card as payment, we use third parties to check the validity of the sort code, account number and card
                number you submit in order to prevent fraud.</p><br><br>
            <h3>One Road data (legitimate interests)</h3><br><br>
            <p>The FIA collects and processes One Road personal data of the members of its Member Clubs, to allow
                analysis and reporting of its cross-Club One Road partner offers. Where you make a purchase through a
                One Road offer at an FIA partner, details of this purchase are shared with the FIA, which in turn shares
                this information with your Member Club. This collection and sharing is based on the FIA’s legitimate
                interest in ensuring Member Clubs have access to more profitable offers, and that individual members
                have access to higher value offers.</p><br>
            <p>This information is shared with Member Clubs and with Partners, and with the FIA’s third-party IT service
                providers involved in the development and maintenance of the One Road Platform.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Market research and policy campaigning (legitimate interests)</h3><br><br>
            <p>The FIA’s mobility teams, including the Automobile Mobility and Tourism Regions, process personal data in
                connection with their research into mobility issues and adoption of policy positions, including in the
                creation of policy documents, research papers and educational and press materials. To do this, the FIA
                may collect your identification data, contact details, employment and business information, and research
                data.</p><br>
            <p>This information will be shared within research and policy publications, or articles we produce or
                contribute towards, typically in pseudonymous or aggregated form. We may also share this content, and
                some underlying information, with policy stakeholders, policy makers and journalists on legislative
                issues, or in communicating the FIA’s views on policy objectives. We may also share information with
                researchers, who may share their own privacy notices, and with our service providers including IT
                service providers. We also share information with our professional advisers as required.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Processing your job application (legitimate interests, explicit consent)</h3><br><br>
            <p>We collect and use your personal data so we can process your application. We store, and where needed,
                update, your personal information to make informed decisions on recruitment and assess your suitability
                for the role, to communicate with you about your application, to respond to your inquiries and schedule
                interviews, and to reimburse you for any agreed expenses incurred in the application process. If you
                need to provide us with details of your health, to offer you reasonable adjustments, we will process
                this on the basis of your consent to the extent required by applicable data protection laws.
            </p><br>
            <p>We have an interest in carrying out appropriate checks to verify the information provided by candidates.
                We verify the details you have supplied and, where applicable, conduct pre-employment background checks.
            </p><br>
            <p>To do this we use your identification data, contact details and application related information.</p><br>
            <p>This information will be shared with companies that assist us with recruitment and provide IT system or
                support. We also share information with our professional advisers as required.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Business interests (legitimate interests establishment, exercise and defence of legal claims)</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>We have an interest in protecting our business interests and legal rights, including, use in connection
                with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, auditing, investigative and disciplinary purposes and ethics
                and compliance reporting requirements. We may also use your information where necessary to protect the
                security of our premises, assets, systems, and intellectual property and enforce company policies,
                including protecting ourselves from fraud and verifying the individuals with which we interact as
                appropriate. Where we process your special category data for these purposes, we will typically rely upon
                our need to establish, exercise or defend ourselves from legal claims.</p><br>
            <p>To do this, we store, use and may transmit any of the information identified in this notice.</p><br>
            <p>This information will be shared with companies who assist us with relevant processing, including IT
                service providers. We also share information with legal and other professional advisers as required.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Compliance with law (legal obligation)</h3><br><br>
            <p>Where necessary to comply with a legal obligation we store and use your data. We have a legal obligation
                to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>obtain parental consent to provide online services to children under 16. However, most of our
                    websites are not designed for children under 16;</li>
                <li>respond to requests by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation; and
                </li>
                <li>keep certain records for health and safety purposes and in relation to purchases made;</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>We may process any of the types of data mentioned in this notice for these purposes.</p><br>
            <p>This information will be shared as required to comply with law, including with law enforcement or public
                authorities as required.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing</h3><br><br>
            <p>Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent. In some cases, we are
                able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You
                have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing,
                at any time. You can do this by following the instructions in the communication where this is an
                electronic message, or by contacting us using the details set out below.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Who will we share this data with, where and when?</h3><br><br>
            <p>Your data may be shared with a variety of third parties as described above. Personal data is also shared
                as necessary within the FIA and within the FIA group, including with our commercial, mobility, legal,
                privacy and IT departments. Your personal data will be shared with the FIA’s third-party service
                providers, who will process it on behalf of the FIA for the purposes identified above. This may include
                the providers of insurance services, IT and technology services, survey providers and event organisers.
                We also share information with our professional advisers. Some of our suppliers may be separate data
                controllers, and may provide you with their own privacy notice where appropriate.</p><br>
            <p>We will share information with relevant third parties, such as Mobility Clubs, where this is the required
                for the purposes set out above. We will also share data with third parties who assist with our meetings,
                events, courses and competitions as necessary to ensure that your attendance is appropriately managed
                and we will share appropriate data with third party ticketing providers as necessary to manage our
                ticketing processes. As part of its One Road co-ordination role, FIA also shares information about Club
                Members’ use of FIA Partner offers with their Member Clubs.</p><br>
            <p>Personal data may be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials if required for
                the purposes above, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate
                interests in compliance with applicable laws.</p><br>
            <p>In the event that FIA’s business is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be
                disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser's adviser and will be passed to the new owners
                of the business as required for the purposes above.</p><br>
            <p>For a number of purposes set out above, the data sharing described is likely to result in the sharing of
                your data with third parties located outside your country; in principle, this may be any country in the
                world. Where information is transferred outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, and where this is to a
                third party in a country that is not to a country considered adequate under Swiss, EU or UK law, data is
                usually adequately protected by approved standard contractual clauses, or a vendor's Processor Binding
                Corporate Rules. In some limited circumstances our transfers may be exempt from adequacy obligations,
                where transfers are for important reasons of public interest, such as sharing of data for anti-doping
                purposes. Where we transfer on the basis of an adequacy mechanism, a copy of the relevant mechanism can
                be provided for your review on request by contacting us using the details set out below.</p><br><br>
            <h3>What rights do I have?</h3><br><br>
            <p>You have the right to <span>ask us for a copy</span> of your personal data; to <span>correct,
                    delete</span> or <span>restrict</span> (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to
                <span>obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured,
                    machine-readable format.</span>
            </p><br>
            <p>In addition, you can <span>object to the processing</span> of your personal data in some circumstances
                (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal
                requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).</p><br>
            <p>These <spam>rights may be limited,</spam> for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal
                data about another person, where it would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or
                if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate
                interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in European, Swiss and UK data protection laws
                and under applicable member state laws. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when
                responding to any request you make.</p><br>
            <p>To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us – or our Data Protection Officer – using the details
                set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU data protection
                authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred. This may be the CNIL in
                France. You may also complain to the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner in
                Switzerland.</p><br>
            <p>We will always inform you where information you provide is mandatory. Information that is provided in
                order to comply with the FIA’s various rules and regulations listed above is mandatory. Failure to
                provide this information breach our regulations.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Details of the FIA as a controller</h3><br><br>
            <p>The FIA has two primary entities: a French association having its registered office in 8 Place de la
                Concorde, Paris, and a Swiss association having its registered office in 2 Chemin de Blandonnet, Geneva.
            </p><br>
            <p>Both entities work together as joint controllers in the processing of personal data relating to the FIA’s
                main activities. These entities collaborate on the determination of the purposes and means of processing
                described in this notice. The FIA may, from time to time, identify a specific FIA entity that is
                responsible for a certain processing activity. Where this takes place, it will make this clear within
                this notice and any other appropriate location.</p><br>
            <p>The FIA’s Swiss association takes primary responsibility for supporting data subjects, and in handling
                any requests data subjects may have. You can find the relevant contact details below.</p><br><br>
            <h3>How do I contact you, or your data protection officer?</h3><br><br>
            <p>We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. If you have any
                concerns about how we process your data, you can get in touch with us and our Data Protection Officer at
                <span style="color: aqua; cursor: pointer;">dpo@fia.com</span> or by writing to: Commercial Legal, 2
                Chemin de Blandonnet, 1215 Geneva 15, Switzerland.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>How long will you retain my data?</h3><br><br>
            <p>FIA will retain and process your personal data for as long as necessary for the purposes identified
                above, including for the purposes of satisfying any specific legal requirements, such as accounting or
                health and safety rules, and, where required for us to assert or defend against legal claims, until the
                end of the relevant limitation period or until the claims in question have been settled.</p><br>
            <p>After this period, we will take steps to delete your personal data or hold it in a form that no longer
                identifies, you provided that we have no further lawful basis requiring us to maintain your data.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Updates to this privacy notice</h3><br><br>
            <p>We reserve the right to update this privacy notice at any time, and we will provide you with a new
                privacy notice when we make any substantial updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to
                time about the processing of your personal information.</p>
